# BlackListMonitor

The purpose of this project is to make it easy to monitor IP's and the blacklists they are on. As any hosting company/user with a number of VM/Instances will quickly realize is the importance of ensuing IP's do not get blacklisted.

At this time the code base only supports two blacklists's but is easily expanded.
